# Project.SEP2
A system that keeps track of evidence data from various criminal cases.

Abstract
This project aims to show a possible solution regarding proper evidence management and tracking. The reason for its creation is to make an effective system that allows the proper management and tracking of evidence in police stations. The system can differentiate between a user and an administrator. Both can view all the evidence data collected or search to find requested information. Only an administrator has access to more features: adding, removing, and updating evidence data. The system takes advantage of the client-server architecture using Javaâ€™s RMI, as well as a PostgreSQL database containing all the data. The achieved result is a system containing the core features that come with evidence management, while providing a layout to something that can turn into a much larger project. Overall, it will allow the proper storing for critical evidence with the opportunity for further expansion.
